Results and documentation related to my 2-month stay at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.
The stay is related to (convolutional) Deep Neural Networks and the experiments are
carried out using state-of-the-art tools such as Caffe (BVLC), TensorFlow (Google) and Torch.

Go to the [experiments](doc/experiments.md) section to see the different tests and whacky experiments carried out with neural nets or visit the [documentation and resources](doc/resources.md) section for a list of interesting publications and tools (including some remarks and comments). 

Remember to download the required image databases and models by running `setup.sh` before you run any of the experiments.
